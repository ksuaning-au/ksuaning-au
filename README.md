### Hello I am Kaj Suaning,

I work as a software engineer specializing in IoT applications.

I obtained a degree in Mechatronics Engineering which provided me with a background in hardware & firmware design. During university I began creating IoT devices as a hobby while I studdied. Eventually I required a way to interface with my IoT devices remotely which led me towards web development. I started by learning HTML/CSS & Javascript through places like [Free Coding Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) which was sped up considerablly thanks to my C/C++ background. After learning the basic frontend technologies chose to learn Python for backend development.

After learning the full stack of web technologies and still at university I started a website building business. This catered mostly to local businesses looking to have a web presence for the first time. This allowed me to gain valuable experience while still studying.

Once I graduated I breifly worked at Cochlear working on digital signal processing algorithms. After which I decided to go into freelancing which I have been doing for the past several years working on the entire IoT stack.

---

Iâ€™m currently working on firmware for Nordic and Espressif devices.
